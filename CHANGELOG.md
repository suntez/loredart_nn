## 2.0.1
- Small fixes in README and comments

## 2.0.0
- Fully rewritten logic based on new Tensors and new backpropagation logic (implicit linear computational graph)
- Extended supported optimizers (with weight decay), layers, activation functions etc
- This version is not compatible with previous ones

Some points that still needs to be worked upon:
- progress bar for model training
- model saving (now only Json is supported)
- support for parallel computations, etc.

## 0.0.2+1
- Assets update

## 0.0.2
- Add implementation of `Minibatch Gradient Descent`
- Change and update DNN logs and behavior

## 0.0.1+2
- Mini update of code and format. 

## 0.0.1
- Initial version. Support DNN with Dense layers, SGD optimizer, variety of activations, and losses.
